This is an attempt to distill some useful ideas from Stoic thought into a single page of short, simple, modern english.

A richer source of Stoic ideas is [Meditations by Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditations). Other sources are the writings of [Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus), [Seneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger), and [Zeno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium).

Even simply looking up quotes by these individuals online is a fruitful exercise.
