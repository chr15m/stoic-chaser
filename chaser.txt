Your thoughts are what makes something good or bad. Your thoughts are under your control.

If you imagine how much worse things could be you will appreciate how they are now.

If you count the good things in your life you will feel happier than if you count the bad things or the things you don't have.

If things don't go right decide whether you have the power to change them. If not, accept fate. If so, change them.

If you want to be content then enjoy things the way they already are instead of wanting them some other way.

If you want to improve yourself imagine a person with the properties you desire and then try to be like them.

Use hardship to train yourself in gratitude for the good times.

How you react to events is what makes them good or bad. You can choose your own reactions.

If somebody offends you, decide if what they say is true. If it is true change yourself. If it is false then laugh.

The universe is self aware because you are part of its fabric.
