    <h1>Stoic Chaser</h1>
<p>Your thoughts are what makes something good or bad. Your thoughts are under your control.</p>

<p>If you imagine how much worse things could be you will appreciate how they are now.</p>

<p>If you count the good things in your life you will feel happier than if you count the bad things or the things you don't have.</p>

<p>If things don't go right decide whether you have the power to change them. If not, accept fate. If so, change them.</p>

<p>If you want to be content then enjoy things the way they already are instead of wanting them some other way.</p>

<p>If you want to improve yourself imagine a person with the properties you desire and then try to be like them.</p>

<p>Use hardship to train yourself in gratitude for the good times.</p>

<p>How you react to events is what makes them good or bad. You can choose your own reactions.</p>

<p>If somebody offends you, decide if what they say is true. If it is true change yourself. If it is false then laugh.</p>

<p>The universe is self aware because you are part of its fabric.</p>  </body>
